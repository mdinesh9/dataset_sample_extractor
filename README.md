# dataset_sample_extractor

### Usage
    - python run.py --root=root_dir --sample_size=200

My root_dir has training and holdout datasets

### Why
    - Developed this script for deep learning projects when you have huge dataset.
    - No point of running deep learning models on complete dataset when you are prototyping.
